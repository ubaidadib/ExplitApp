# ExplitApp
 Explit is a web application that allows you to divide expenditures with your pals. It allows you and your pals to add invoices and keep track of who owes whom, and then it assists you in settling up with one another. Here's a basic rundown of how everything works.                                              To begin, create an account!                                              Create a group after that. Groups are a simple method to distribute costs with a specific number of individuals on a regular basis. You may make a group for your flat or for a ski vacation, for example. You'll be prompted to give contact information for the other members of the group when you create it. This enables all of those people to see the group on Explit and input their own expenditures. Explit also allows you add "non-group costs" for things like going out to dinner with a few random buddies that don't need a full group.
